##Final Project

My final project is an interactive resume. The different sections include:

- About
- Work
- GMS (Global Media Scholars)
- Social Media
- Food Blog
- Contact Information

In order to minimize the amount of the content on each section of the screen, I used hyperlinked images so that the user can learn more about each item on the respective website. 

Users can control the movement of the die using the buttons, and each face corresponds with a specific section of my resume. The dice is in a fixed position, so it moves along with the movement of the resume.

There is also a random button for users to watch the die roll to a random number. **This button will not call a different part of the resume.**
